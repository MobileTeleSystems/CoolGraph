# Contributing Guiud
CoolGraph is an open source project and there are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into CoolGraph itself.

# Bug reports
If you think you have found a bug, please, first make sure that you are testing against the latest version of package - your issue may already have been fixed. If not, search our issues list on GitHub in case a similar issue has already been opened.

# Feature requests
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in CoolGraph, you can open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Contributing code and documentation changes
If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to CoolGraph, please find or open an issue about it first. Talk about what you would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.
